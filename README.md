# WS2021-ExamProjectMaldini
This repository contains the project that I brought as the exam project for the Semantic Web course (42500), University of Bologna.

The project attempts to describe the basic structure and schedule of a 3x3 Summer Tournament of the FIP Circuit, active from this year (2021). Then, it tries to describe a specific Summer Tournament, TheCanestreet, that has been played in Jesi (AN) in July 2021, describing the schedule, the teams, and the structure of it.
