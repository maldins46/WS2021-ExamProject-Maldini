This repository contains the project that I brought as the exam project for the Semantic Web course (42500), University of Bologna.

The project attempts to describe the basic structure and schedule of a 3x3 Summer Tournament of the FIP Circuit, active from this year (2021). 

To do so, a general ontology has been created, called FIP 3x3 Summer Tournament Ontology. This one can be used as a ABox to describe a generic tournament of the FIP 3x3 Summer Circuit.

Then, I tried to describe a specific Summer Tournament, The Canestreet, that has been played in Jesi (AN) in July 2021, describing the schedule, the teams, and the structure of it.

### How to use
You can use the ontology in two ways. First, you can clone the project from GitHub and use the ontologies directly with Proteg√©. This is a safe way to work, as a catalog.xml is provided too, and there is to danger to mess up with the various imports.

Another way is to refer to the ontology from its web position:
- [At this position]() you can access to the FIP 3x3 Summer Tournament Ontology OWL source;
- [At this position]() you can access to The Canestreet Ontology OWL source.
